    Disinformation is purposefully false or untrue information. Nowadays, it can very easily spread through the use of the internet, specifically social media. It is very easy for people like you or me to read something, and be able to easily fall for it due to many factors, especially biases(See bias definitions). 
</p>
<p>
You may think that misinformation doesn't matter to you, but by spreading misinformation you
actively can take part in political shifts and convince others of falsehoods. We can use a variety of approaches to combat the spread of disinformation, but usually, it relies on people like YOU being able to identify, and actively combat the spread of disinformation, see approaches for more. As a result of disinformation, science can get obscured from the public view, and democracy can crumble from outside misinformation. 
</p>
<p>
To increase your awareness, you can use resources such as the fact checker I listed, and encourage others to use them too. You must always keep in mind to focus on finding the truth, and not close your information intake because of fear of misinformation. You can also ask your politicians for funding for media literacy education, or donating to the charities I have listed. Encourage others around you, making sure to push them in the direction of accuracy instead of fear.</p>

<h2>Approaches</h2>
<p>
It's easy to say that all disinformation defence should be delegated to the government, but nowadays, we cannot trust the government to actively moderate what is true and false without bringing in political bias, and can lead to a fall of democracy. 
</p>
<p>
One of the first major approaches that can be used is using a committee, such as the EU, to moderate. Although slightly biased, they are more reliable than individual countries due to the diversity of views available with the EU.
</p>
<p>
The second major approach is the use of individual companies to moderate. This can be used, but companies  need extensive moderation teams, and it can be costly and unreliable to leave companies to moderate their own content.
</p>
<p>
The third, and probably most effective approach is the “civil society” approach. For this, Civil Society organizations such as NGOs or charities need to actively discourage disinformation, and educate others of media literacy. This would require society to volunteer and organizations to discourage disinformation. Usually this is the most effective way of moderation, because you can never stop the never ending stream of false information, so it is important to educate others to identify less biased and more credible media.

<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>
Effects of disinformation: Disinformation can cause worldwide effects, including the destabilization of democracy and distrust in science. This is why it is so important for us to be able to see disinformation, and prevent others from believing it. I will go over some of the more famous cases here.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the MMR Scare. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield released a fraudulent paper in The Lancet, a respected journal at the time. The paper tried to link the MMR vaccine and a made up disease called autistic enterocolitis, meaning the MMR vaccine would give kids autism.This paper, later revealed to be based on false assumptions, and was motivated by a financial incentive, caused worldwide devastating impacts. Impacts include a measles outbreak in the U.S, Canada, and the U.K, as well as political shifts and protests, starting an organized anti-vaccine movement that still goes on to this day.
</p>
<p>
Another more recent example is the Chevron Ecuador oil spill. Texaco, owned by Chevron, operated in the Amazon in Ecuador from 1964 to 1962. Chevron has said that they have dumped 18.5 billion gallons of toxic liquid into the Amazon, contaminating 2 million acres of the Amazon. Chevron is actively using 400 million dollars for legal funds to defend Chevron and spread disinformation about the spill, even though it should take roughly 40 million dollars to clean up Ecuador, which to this day Chevron has not paid a penny of. They have also tried to seize all assets of many of the activists trying to spread information about Chevron, and have been able to sidestep all responsibilities for a long time, mostly due to the disinformation they have spread and silencing all critics, making a global impact.

<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>
Confirmation bias: Whenever we view information, we tend to give more credit to information that already aligns with our previous beliefs, making us less likely to learn new information.
</p>
<p>
Illusory Truth effect: Whenever we view information that we do not believe, we are more likely to believe the information if we see it again or more times over.
</p>
<p>
Echo Chambers: Groups with people of similar beliefs can share information that only aligns with their political bias and can provide people support for false beliefs.
</p>
<p>
Anchor bias: People can rely all of their decisions on the first piece of evidence they see, causing us to lock us into a certain mindset.
