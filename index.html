  <p>Disinformation and misinformation has been extremely pervasive in social media and it has caused impacts in both how we perceive information and how we form our opinions. For example, exposure to information about disinformation can cause people to have confirmation bias.. To identify disinformation, after reading a piece of news or information, reflect about the information, and if it seems suspicious you can use sources listed in the Fact Checking page to check the validity. You can also make a change, by making donations to the charities listed in the Charities tab. </p>
