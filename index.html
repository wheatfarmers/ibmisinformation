  <p> Disinformation is purposefully false or untrue information. Nowadays, it can very easily spread through the use of the internet, specifically social media. It is very easy for people like you or me to read something, and be able to easily fall for it due to many factors, especially biases(See bias definitions). 


You may think that misinformation doesn't matter to you, but by spreading misinformation you
actively can take part in political shifts and convince others of falsehoods. We can use a variety of approaches to combat the spread of disinformation, but usually, it relies on people like YOU being able to identify, and actively combat the spread of disinformation, see approaches for more. As a result of disinformation, science can get obscured from the public view, and democracy can crumble from outside misinformation. 


To increase your awareness, you can use resources such as the fact checker I listed, and encourage others to use them too. You must always keep in mind to focus on finding the truth, and not close yourself because of fear of misinformation. You can also ask your politicians for funding for media literacy education, or donating to the charities I have listed. Encourage others around you, making sure to push them in the direction of accuracy instead of fear.
